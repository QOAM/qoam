            <h3 id="hybrid-journals">Why are hybrid journals also included in QOAM?</h3>
            <p>Author centric, QOAM provides all journals that offer open access publishing. This entails hybrid journals. Some hybrid journals manage to generate a double income by charging both readers (via full library subscriptions) and authors (via full publication fees).<br />The initiators of QOAM despise this ‘double dipping’ but QOAM is not the instrument to combat this directly. However, if institutions succeed in negotiating journal licenses that end these practices, the license results and more specifically their effect on the publication fees will be mentioned on QOAM’s web site. For example, SURFmarket succeeded to settle such deals with SAGE and the Royal Society of Chemistry on behalf of UKB, the Dutch consortium of university libraries and the National Library. Some of these contracts have non-disclosure clauses and the information may only be available after logging in with ones institutional account.</p>

            <h3 id="subscription-journals">Why are subscription journals not included in QOAM?</h3>
            <p>QOAM is in the overlap of three domains: (1) Quality, (2) Open Access, (3) Market. Do subscription journals fit into these domains?<br />Ad 1. Quality. Yes. The Journal Score Card is business model neutral.<br />Ad 2. Open Access. No. Subscription is at odds with Open Access.<br />Ad 3. Market. No. The current Big Deal packages obscure any market idea.<br />So, subscription journals do not fit in QOAM. Yet, the initiators of QOAM are convinced that quality control as such is equally well necessary for subscription journals. Especially for new journals which are simply included in existing packages. The Journal Score Card, or an adapted version of it, might be applicable here and the initiators of QOAM are open to discuss this.</p>

            <h3 id="cant-find-journal">Why don’t I find a specific journal</h3>
            <h4>A. in QOAM’s <a href="@Url.Action("Index", "Journals")" title="searching section">searching section?</a></h4>
            <p>The reason is that for this journal no Journal Score Cards have been published yet. To remedy this, go to the “I want to publish a Journal Score Card” section on QOAM’s main page and publish a JSC for the journal in question. Alternatively, ask your library to do so.</p>

            <h4>B. in QOAM’s <a href="@Url.Action("Index", "Score")" title="scoring section">scoring section?</a></h4>
            <p>We suggest to ask your library for advice. They know how to have a journal added to external databases that underly QOAM – currently DOAJ and Ulrich’s database - and/or how to migrate a journal from there to QOAM. Once done the journal will pop up in QOAM (provided it is an OA or hybrid journal).</p>

            <h3 id="no-metrics">Why does QOAM not include metrics as a quality proxy?</h3>
            <p>Metrics for QOAM must apply to young journals because most  journals which are born OA are in their infancy. Therefore, the Journal Impact Factor is not included. The Leiden institute CWTS developed an Editorial Board Indicator, a metric for the scientific impact of the editorial board. The main obstacle for applying it is the problem of identifying the board members; just a name and an affiliation are not enough for that. The importance of having a clear identification of the Editorial Board members of scientific journals (i.e. their full names, affiliations, e-mail and even their ORCID identifier) can be also considered as an element of transparency and quality. Should these data be more transparent and accessible, indicators on the scientific impact of the editorial board could then be extensively developed and included in QOAM. See <a href="http://www.surf.nl/en/publicaties/Pages/CWTSrapport.aspx">SURF</a>. Other straightforward young journal metrics would be welcomed by QOAM as well.</p>

            <h3 id="framing">Is QOAM prone to improper use?</h3>
            <p>
                To avoid unqualified contributions to QOAM, only members of the academic community may publish Journal Score Cards. Per person only one JSC may be published for a specific journal. Published Journal Score Cards are non-anonymous and their authors may contact each other via the <a href="@Url.Action("Index", "Profiles")" title="Profiles section">Profiles section</a> of QOAM. Read more about QOAM’s <a href="@Url.Action("About")#privacy" title="Privacy policy">Privacy policy.</a><br />

                Currently, QOAM has no resources to organise any form of social control or moderation. We have to rely on academic vigilance. Jeffrey Beall’s <a href="http://scholarlyoa.com/individual-journals/" title="list of predatory journals">list of predatory journals</a> and John Bohannon’s article <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6154/60.full" title="Who is Afraid of Peer Review?">Who is Afraid of Peer Review?</a> are examples of this.
