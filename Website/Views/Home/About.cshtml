            <h3 id="quality-of-service">QOAM – quality of service matched against price</h3>
            <p>
                When scientific and scholarly publishing is no longer seen as copyright exploitation but as a service, as is the case in the OA paradigm, there is a need for a market where quality of the service can be matched against price. Quality Open Access Market – QOAM – wants to be that place. The information in QOAM is based on academic crowd sourcing, coming from authors, editors and peer reviewers who bring in their real life experience with a journal and from libraries who analyse the web site of a journal. Additional price information comes from institutions which have settled open access licenses with publishers for their own authors. Thus, QOAM becomes the meeting point where shopping authors select a journal to publish their article in, publishers may find out how to improve their journal and funders, policy makers, journalists and the public at large enter a transparant academic publishing environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Obviously, QOAM is an open website. But academics have to log in with their institutional account for publishing a Journal Score Card (to avoid anonymous scoring) or if they want to check if their own institution has bargained a good publication price for them (see <a href="#price-information">Price information</a>).

            <h3 id="journal-score-cards">Journal Score Cards</h3>
            <p>In QOAM quality of a journal is determined by the academic community itself via so called Journal Score Cards. A Journal Score Card is a questionnaire on  critical aspects of a journal. Four aspects – Editorial information, Peer review, Governance and Process - are usually analysed by library staff, based on the journal’s website. The fifth – Valuation – is a reality check, preferably based on experience of authors, editors or peer reviewers with the  journal. The lowest subscore of the four web site related aspects is called the Base Score of the journal. The score of the fifth aspect is called the Valuation score of the jounal. The Base Score defines the default ranking of the journals in QOAM but ranking according to the Valuation Score is also possible.

            <h3 id="filtering-per-discipline">Filtering per discipline</h3>
            <p>QOAM allows filtering per discipline. Thus the varied recognition of the different aspects over the disciplines can be taken into account. E.g. if speed of publication is less important in a specific discipline all journals in this discipline will produce a low subscore for the aspect ‘process’, which might be their Base Score. As in QOAM journals are ranked by default according to their Base score, a general search would result in a place at the bottom of the list for these journals. Within their own discipline the other aspects are more profiling. </p>

            <h3 id="price-information">Price information</h3>
            <p>
                Price information in QOAM comes primarily from the website of a journal via its Journal Score Card.  However, a growing number of institutions, and more specifically their libraries, succeed in negotiating better prices for their community via memberships, licences or other agreements. Unfortunately, publishers often include non-disclosure clauses in their contracts. Therefore, these prices may not always be  directly visible on QOAM’s website. Per journal QOAM will list the licensed institutes. Searching authors can see if their institute is on the list. In that case they can click on it, log in to their own institutional intranet and compare the institutional price to the standard price.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, prices vary widely. According to <a href="http://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/fos/newsletter/11-02-06.htm#nofee" title="No-fee open-access journals">Peter Suber</a> the vast majority of peer-reviewed OA journals are no-fee. OA journals that do charge have an <a href="http://www.openaccesspublishing.org/apc2/" title="A Study of Open Access Journals Using Article Processing Charges">average price of &euro;700</a> per article, <a href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/stellent/groups/corporatesite/@("@")policy_communications/documents/web_document/wtp055910.pdf" title="Hybrid journals">hybrid journals are the most expensive of all</a> with an average of €1970. Individual price quotations may mount to €3000 and up. In such a bewildering situation sharing price experiences might give some guidance. For that reason a question is included in the Valuation aspect asking for the actual publication price of a published article. The replies are shown in reverse chronological order under the heading ‘Recently paid’, next to ‘Institutional price’ and ‘Price on web site’. All three are found by clicking on ‘Price information’ on QOAM’s Search page.

            <h3 id="privacy">Privacy policy</h3>
            <p>
                QOAM is a free service, based on academic crowd sourcing. QOAM uses no cookies and can be visited anonimously. Conversely, contributions to QOAM’s content via Journal Score Cards are named and only members of the academic community are eligible to publish such cards.
            </p>
            <p>
                In order to publish a Journal Score Card in QOAM – via “Score journal” on QOAM’s main page – one has to log in via one’s institutional account. In practice this means that QOAM collects the names and institutional email adresses of the authors of Journal Score Cards. The names are used to sign the Journal Score Cards and are publicly visible. The institutional email adresses are not publicly available. They are only shown to other authors of Journal Score Cards. No other information is collected. No other uses of these data are foreseen.
            </p>
            <p>
                Underlying this policy are the views that (1) anonimous Journal Score Cards are prone to misuse and should be avoided in QOAM and (2) authors of Journal Score Cards should be able to contact each other for dialogue.

            <h3 id="brief-history">A brief history</h3>

            <p>For long, SURF has been convinced that in the OA paradigm, next to price quality is a critical issue. For established journals the Journal Impact Factor, though controversial, is used as a proxy for quality but for young journals there is no such quality indicator whatsoever. This is a specific handicap for young OA journals whereas young subscription journals are often just included in Big Deal packages. The outcomes of the <a href="http://project-soap.eu/report-from-the-soap-symposium/" title="EC-project SOAP">EC-project SOAP</a> confirmed a growing urgency to address the quality issue for OA journals (later alarmingly demonstrated by  the emergence of <a href="http://scholarlyoa.com/individual-journals/" title="predatory journals">predatory journals</a> and John Bohannon’s article <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6154/60.full" title="Who is Afraid of Peer Review?">Who is Afraid of Peer Review?</a>)</p>

            <p>
                As early as 2009 SURF took the initiative to investigate the feasibility of an accreditation system for young OA journals. The idea was embraced by the European Commission but rejected by SURF’s OpenAIRE project partners (who stuck to the Green Road to OA). Publishers and funders reacted expectantly. SURF left this approach after all and, in hindsight, it might have been too ambitious.

            <p>
                In autumn 2011 a new endeavour was started, this time aiming at tools that would enable a crowd sourced solution. For that purpose two indicators were prototyped: an Editorial Board Indicator, a metric for the scientific impact of the editorial board, and a Transparency Indicator, checking the transparency of the article admission process. Both indicators were presented, and the second one even tested, at an international expert colloquium in Rotterdam, October 2012.
            </p>

            <p>
                The main obstacle for the first indicator was, and still is, the problem of identifying the board members; just a name and an affiliation are not enough for that. (See FAQ <a href="@Url.Action("Faq")#no-metrics" title="Why does QOAM not include metrics as a quality proxy?">“Why does QOAM not include metrics as a quality proxy?”</a>) The second indicator turned out to be more readily applicable as was demonstrated by the test in Rotterdam and subsequently by a group of Dutch university libraries. These encouraging results led to the development of the more comprehensive Journal Score Card as a first measure of young journal quality.
