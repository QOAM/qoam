Dear Sir/Madam,

Recently, you have published an open access article in the journal <<Journal>>.

Open access publishing is a reatively new phenomenon. More and more research funders require it and the number of open access journals is growing rapidly. Both the quality of these journals and their publication fees vary widely.  At the same time, academia needs a transparant and reliable publishing environment. 

No wonder that your colleagues may be well interested in your experience with the journal you just published in. That's why we invite you to share your experiences  by completing a Valuation Score Card for this journal. Your card will be brought out at the Quality Open Access Market (<<QOAM>>) which also includes Base Score Cards produced by libraries analysing journals' web sites. Thus, QOAM is fully based on academic crowd sourcing. It is a meeting point where shopping authors may select a journal to publish their article in, publishers may find out how to improve their journal and funders, policy makers, journalists and the public at large enter a transparent academic publishing forum. 

If you are prepared to contribute to this environment, please press the link below. After logging in you will be forwarded to a mini-questionnaire. Completing it will only take you a few minutes. Thanks for your time.
