Subject: New generated password for Quality Open Access Market (QOAM)

Hello @ViewBag.DisplayName,

In the past you have registered with Quality Open Access Market – QOAM – in order to publish a Journal Score Card or you just came along to find out about QOAM. At these occasions you logged in using your institutional account.

However, the underlying system (eduGAIN) turned out to be too complex and burocratic for our purposes and international access to QOAM stagnated for almost a year. We are happy now to announce that, as of today, we have migrated to another, simpler procedure. Basically, we have adopted the ResearchGate approach.

For new end-users the differences are minimal. They still have to use their institutional email address as user-id. But they may now choose their own password (which, by the way, could be their institutional password as well).

To existing registrants, like you, we have assigned a password that you should use next time you log in to QOAM. We strongly advise you to change your password immediately after login.

Your password is: @ViewBag.GeneratedPassword
You can change your password on this page: @ViewBag.Url

Hopefully you will soon log in to QOAM and continu publishing Journal Score Cards. On our part we will resume inviting the international academic community to make QOAM their common open access market place.

For comments and questions please use QOAM’s Contact box.
