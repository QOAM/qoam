            <h3 id="journal-score-cards">Journal Score Cards</h3>
            <p>
                In QOAM libraries use a <strong>Base Score Card</strong> to score the transparency of a journal’s website with respect to four critical journal aspects: Editorial information, Peer review, Governance and Workflow.
                Authors share their experience by completing a 2-minute <strong>Valuation Score Card</strong>.
                QOAM has light weight procedures to invite authors to publish a Valuation Score Card for a journal they just published in.<br />
                Both score cards constitute the SWOT matrix of a journal thus categorizing the journals into Strong, Weaker, Opportunity (to publishers) and Threat (to authors).
                Read more about @Html.ActionLink("Journal Score Cards", "JournalScoreCard"). QOAM also mirrors the <a href="https://doajournals.wordpress.com/2015/06/11/doaj-seal-is-now-live-on-the-site/">DOAJ Seal of Approval</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                The default sorting of the journal list is by robust scores. The robustness of a score is defined as 1 + logN, with N being the number of scorers. The postion of a journal on the list is defined by the product of four factors: Base score, robustness of base score, Valuation score, robustness of valuation score.

            <h3 id="filtering-per-discipline">Filtering per discipline</h3>
            <p>QOAM allows filtering per discipline. Thus the varied recognition of the different aspects over the disciplines can be taken into account. E.g. if speed of publication is less important in a specific discipline all journals in this discipline will produce a low sub score for the aspect ‘Workflow’. Within their own discipline the other aspects are more profiling. </p>

            <h3 id="price-information">Price information</h3>
            <p>
                Price information in QOAM is found via the tab ‘Price information’ on the detail page of a journal under the respective headings ‘Price on web site’, ‘Institutional price’ and ‘Recently paid’.<br/>
                The first one is gathered via a question in the Base Score Card.<br/>
                Information about institutional prices comes from licence brokers, like SURFmarket, or from publishers. Italicized journal titles in the journal list indicate the presence of licences or memberships. The institutions involved are mentioned under ‘Institutional price’.<br />
                Finally, a question is included in the Valuation Score Card asking for the actual publication fee paid by an author.

            <p>
                QOAM is a free service, based on academic crowd sourcing. QOAM uses no cookies and can be visited anonymously. Conversely, contributions to QOAM’s content via Journal Score Cards are named.
                In order to publish a Journal Score Card in QOAM one has to log in via one’s institutional email address.<br />
                In practice this means that QOAM collects the names and institutional email addresses of the authors of Journal Score Cards. No other information is collected. The names are used to sign the Journal Score Cards and are publicly visible. However, an author’s institutional email adress is only shown to other authors of Journal Score Cards. No other uses of these data are foreseen.<br />
                Underlying this policy are the views that (1) anonymous Journal Score Cards are prone to misuse and should be avoided in QOAM and (2) authors of Journal Score Cards should be able to contact each other for dialogue.<br />
                Finally, QOAM uses the https protocol for secure exchange of data. QOAM data are stored in the Netherlands and governed by Dutch c.q. European law.
